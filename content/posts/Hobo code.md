Listen up y'all, I got a story to tell
About a code, that helped hobos survive and do well
In the days of the Great Depression, life was tough
But they found a way to make it, with the help of this code, that was rough

Chorus:
The Hobo Code, it was a way to communicate
With symbols on the walls, and a language that was great
For the hobos of the time, it was a lifesaver
Helping them find food, shelter, and a place to stay together

Verse 2:
The symbols were simple, yet they conveyed so much
With a glance, a hobo could tell if it was safe to touch
A house with a circle meant that food was to be had
A cross meant danger, and it was best to be sad

Chorus:
The Hobo Code, it was a way to communicate
With symbols on the walls, and a language that was great
For the hobos of the time, it was a lifesaver
Helping them find food, shelter, and a place to stay together

Verse 3:
The Hobo Code was a symbol of hope
It showed that despite their struggles, they still had a way to cope
It was a symbol of unity, in a time of strife
And it helped the hobos make it through, and live a better life

Chorus:
The Hobo Code, it was a way to communicate
With symbols on the walls, and a language that was great
For the hobos of the time, it was a lifesaver
Helping them find food, shelter, and a place to stay together

Outro:
So when you see the symbols, on a wall or a train
Remember the Hobo Code, and the struggles of the time and the pain
It's a reminder of what people can achieve
When they work together, and they believe.
