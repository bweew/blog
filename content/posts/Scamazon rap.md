Title: Scammed On Amazon 
---
Verse 1:
I thought I found a great deal, a handheld gaming gem
But little did I know, it was a scam from them
I placed my order on Amazon, excited for the new toy
But then I got a message, that filled me with annoy

Chorus:
The package was gone, the tracking number was fake
I fell for their trap, my heart began to ache
Feeling stupid and ashamed, didn't want to tell
But it's important to speak out, and break the scammers' spell

Verse 2:
FedEx sent a message, that my package was delivered
But to an address, that wasn't mine, my heart quivered
I checked the tracking number, and to my surprise
It was a fake one, the scammers were so wise

Chorus:
The package was gone, the tracking number was fake
I fell for their trap, my heart began to ache
Feeling stupid and ashamed, didn't want to tell
But it's important to speak out, and break the scammers' spell

Verse 3:
I felt like a fool, for falling for their game
But then I realized, it could happen to anyone the same
The scammers thrive in silence, and we must break the trend
By speaking out and warning others, so they won't fall in

Chorus:
The package was gone, the tracking number was fake
I fell for their trap, my heart began to ache
Feeling stupid and ashamed, didn't want to tell
But it's important to speak out, and break the scammers' spell

Outro:
Don't be afraid to speak up, don't be ashamed
Getting scammed can happen to anyone, it's not a game
So be vigilant and cautious, and spread the word
Let's break the silence, and let the scammers know we won't be deterred.
