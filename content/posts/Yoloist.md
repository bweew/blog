Title: Yoloist
---


(Opening scene: We see a man, Dave, standing on the edge of a cliff. He is dressed in a suit and has a parachute on his back. He takes a deep breath and looks out at the view before him.)

Dave: YOLO! (jumps off the cliff)

(We hear the sound of the parachute opening and see Dave safely gliding through the air. He lands on the ground and takes off his parachute.)

Dave: (pumping his fist in the air) That was amazing! I love living life to the fullest. You only live once, right?

(Fast forward to a year later. Dave is at a funeral, standing next to a casket. His demeanor is solemn and serious.)

Dave: (to the person next to him) I can't believe he's gone. He was so young.

Person: Yeah, it's a real tragedy.

Dave: (to himself) This is all my fault. If only I hadn't convinced him to go skydiving with me that day.

(Person walks away, leaving Dave alone. He looks down at his hands, deep in thought.)

Dave: (to himself) Maybe YOLO isn't the best way to live life after all. Maybe I need to start thinking about the consequences of my actions.

(Fast forward to another year later. Dave is now working as a safety inspector.)

Dave: (to a group of construction workers) Okay, guys, let's make sure we're following all safety protocols. We don't want any accidents on the job.

Construction worker: (sarcastically) Thanks for the reminder, Dave. We wouldn't want to have any fun while we're working.

Dave: (smiling) Actually, safety is pretty fun too. You get to live without the worry of getting hurt.

Construction worker: (surprised) You know what, Dave? You're right. Maybe we should start taking safety more seriously.

Dave: (grinning) Now, that's what I like to hear.

(Final scene: Dave is at a coffee shop with a friend.)

Friend: So, what are you up to this weekend, Dave?

Dave: (smiling) I'm taking a cooking class.

Friend: (surprised) Cooking? Since when are you interested in that?

Dave: (shrugging) Since I realized that living life to the fullest doesn't mean taking unnecessary risks. It means trying new things, exploring different hobbies, and taking care of yourself and others.

Friend: (nodding) That's a good lesson to learn.

Dave: (smiling) Yeah, you only live once, so why not make the most of it in a positive way?

(Fade to black.)
