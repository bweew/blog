title: Administrative Privileges 
---


Verse 1:
I got the power, the rights to rule
With my admin privileges, I'm the king of the school
Gotta keep the systems tight, secure from all the hacks
Making sure everything runs smoothly, with no room for cracks

Chorus:
I'm the administrator, with access to the crown
Making decisions, all the way to the top-notch town
Keeping the servers running, with all my technical skills
I got the privileges, the power to make it all thrill

Verse 2:
I'm in charge of the database, and everything that's inside
Making sure the data's safe, with no chance for it to collide
From backups to updates, I got it all under control
With my admin privileges, I'm the king of this virtual world

Chorus:
I'm the administrator, with access to the crown
Making decisions, all the way to the top-notch town
Keeping the servers running, with all my technical skills
I got the privileges, the power to make it all thrill

Bridge:
I got the power to create, and the power to delete
With my admin privileges, I'm the king of the beat
From network security, to software deployment
I'm the one who's in charge, with no room for disappointment

Chorus:
I'm the administrator, with access to the crown
Making decisions, all the way to the top-notch town
Keeping the servers running, with all my technical skills
I got the privileges, the power to make it all thrill

Outro:
So listen up all y'all, and hear what I say
With my admin privileges, I'm here to stay
Making sure everything's running, with no room for error
I'm the king of the servers, with my administrative terror.
