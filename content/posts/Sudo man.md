Title="Sudo man"
---

Setting: An office with two coworkers, Bob and Alice, sitting at their desks. Bob is typing away on his computer while Alice is leaning back in her chair.]

Bob: [frustrated] Ugh, why won't this command work? I keep getting a permission denied error.

Alice: [chuckles] Did you try using sudo?

Bob: Sudo? What's that?

Alice: [smiling] It's like a magic word that gives you superpowers. With sudo, you can do anything you want on the computer.

Bob: [intrigued] Really? How does it work?

Alice: [leaning forward] It's simple. Just type "sudo" before any command and enter your password. And voila! You're now the king of the computer.

Bob: [impressed] Wow, that sounds amazing. Let me try it. [types "sudo rm -rf /" into the command prompt]

Alice: [eyes widening in horror] Wait, Bob, what are you doing?!

Bob: [smiling confidently] I'm using sudo to delete all the files on the computer. This is going to be awesome!

Alice: [panicking] No, no, no! Stop, Bob, stop!

[The lights flicker and a loud explosion is heard. Smoke fills the room as Bob and Alice cough and cover their faces. A figure emerges from the smoke, wearing a cape and carrying a sword.]

Figure: [in a deep voice] Who dares to use sudo without caution?

Bob: [terrified] Oh my God, what have I done?

Alice: [also scared] Please, sir, we didn't know what we were doing.

Figure: [calming down] Fear not, mortals. I am Sudo Man, protector of the Linux universe. I have come to teach you the ways of the command line.

Bob: [in awe] Sudo Man? Is that really you?

Sudo Man: [nodding] Yes, and I have seen many reckless users like you who think they can wield the power of sudo without consequences. But with great power comes great responsibility.

Alice: [nodding fervently] We understand, Sudo Man. Please, teach us the ways of the command line so we can use sudo safely.

Sudo Man: [smiling] Very well, young ones. Let us begin.

[The smoke clears and Sudo Man begins to give Bob and Alice a crash course in Linux commands. The sketch ends with the three of them typing away on their computers, with Bob and Alice using sudo with caution and respect under the watchful eye of Sudo Man.]
