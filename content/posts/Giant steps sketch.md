Title: Giant Steps
---
[The sketch opens with John Coltrane standing at the front of a room, surrounded by a group of jazz musicians, all looking a bit worse for wear. Coltrane is holding a cup of coffee and looking very serious.]

John Coltrane: Welcome to Giant Steps, the recovery program for jazz musicians. My name is John, and I'll be your guide through this process.

[The musicians all murmur in agreement, looking around nervously.]

John Coltrane: Now, the first step is admitting that you have a problem. Who here has been playing the same old standards for years?

[Several musicians raise their hands, looking embarrassed.]

John Coltrane: It's okay, you're among friends. But we're here to help you break out of that rut and start playing something new.

[The musicians nod, looking a bit more hopeful.]

John Coltrane: Now, the second step is learning to take risks. Who here is afraid to try something new?

[A few musicians raise their hands, looking apprehensive.]

John Coltrane: It's understandable, but we're going to help you push past that fear. We'll start with some basic exercises, like playing a song in a different key or using a new chord progression. And eventually, you'll be able to take those giant steps and create something truly original.

[The musicians nod, looking inspired.]

John Coltrane: Now, the third step is all about practice. Who here has been neglecting their scales and arpeggios?

[Most of the musicians raise their hands, looking guilty.]

John Coltrane: Don't worry, we've all been there. But if you want to truly master your instrument, you need to put in the time and effort. We'll help you set up a practice routine that works for you.

[The musicians nod, looking determined.]

John Coltrane: And finally, the fourth step is all about community. Who here has been feeling isolated or alone in their musical journey?

[A few musicians raise their hands, looking a bit sad.]

John Coltrane: Well, you're not alone anymore. We're all in this together, and we'll be here to support you every step of the way. We'll even organize some jam sessions and gigs so you can show off your new skills.

[The musicians all cheer, looking excited.]

John Coltrane: So, are you ready to take those giant steps and become the jazz musicians you were meant to be?

[The musicians all nod enthusiastically, looking inspired and ready to start their journey towards musical greatness. The sketch ends with Coltrane leading them in a rousing rendition of "Giant Steps."]
