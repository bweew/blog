Let me introduce you to the world of regex,
It's a powerful tool, you'll never be vexed,
With matching patterns, it's quite complex,
But once you get the hang, you'll be an expert, next.

Chorus:
Regular expressions, matchin' strings with ease,
From emails to URLs, they never cease,
To be a lifesaver, and bring relief,
They're the king of pattern matching, beyond belief.

Verse 2:
With symbols and metacharacters, they rule the game,
Dot, star, and bracket, they all have a name,
Anchors and quantifiers, they're all in the mix,
With them, you can do anything, it's just a quick fix.

Chorus:
Regular expressions, matchin' strings with ease,
From emails to URLs, they never cease,
To be a lifesaver, and bring relief,
They're the king of pattern matching, beyond belief.

Verse 3:
In programming, they're used with great might,
In text editors, they make your search light,
In databases, they keep the data right,
They're the power tool, to make your life bright.

Chorus:
Regular expressions, matchin' strings with ease,
From emails to URLs, they never cease,
To be a lifesaver, and bring relief,
They're the king of pattern matching, beyond belief.

Outro:
So embrace the power, of this pattern king,
With it, you can do anything,
Regular expressions, they're the real deal,
Matching patterns, and making it real.
