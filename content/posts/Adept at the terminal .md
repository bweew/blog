Title: Adept At The Terminal
---

Verse 1:
I'm the king of the terminal, a hacker at heart
With my Raspberry Pi, I run it all from the start
I use tmux for my sessions, I keep them all detached
I never miss a beat, I always stay matched

Chorus:
Adept at the terminal, I'm the one to see
Running Raspberry Pi headless, as smooth as can be
With tmux and detached sessions, midnight commander too
I control it all with ease, this is what I do

Verse 2:
Midnight commander's my tool, for file management supreme
I navigate with ease, it's a part of my routine
And when it comes to audio, I've got Sox on my side
I manipulate sound with precision, it's my secret pride

Chorus:
Adept at the terminal, I'm the one to see
Running Raspberry Pi headless, as smooth as can be
With tmux and detached sessions, midnight commander too
I control it all with ease, this is what I do

Bridge:
I'm a tech wizard, with my skills I reign supreme
My terminal commands, they always seem to beam
With each keystroke, I control the digital world
My mastery of the terminal, a story to be told

Chorus:
Adept at the terminal, I'm the one to see
Running Raspberry Pi headless, as smooth as can be
With tmux and detached sessions, midnight commander too
I control it all with ease, this is what I do

Outro:
So if you need a hand, with your terminal command
Just hit me up, I'll take control of your land
I'll make your system run, like a well-oiled machine
With my skills at the terminal, I'm the king supreme.
