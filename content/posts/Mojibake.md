Title: Mojibake
---
Mojibake, what a funky word,
Sounds like something absurd,
But it's a real problem, don't you know,
A digital issue that can make words go.

It happens when characters get mixed up,
And the text becomes unreadable and rough,
Jumbled and garbled, it's a mess,
A headache for anyone trying to assess.

Japanese kanji, Chinese characters, and more,
When they get scrambled, it's hard to ignore,
Mojibake strikes without warning,
And can leave your text utterly deformed.

But fear not, there is a solution,
Unicode can end this confusion,
With its universal character encoding,
Mojibake can be prevented from exploding.

So next time you see that jumbled mess,
Remember, it's not just gibberish,
It's mojibake, a digital foe,
But with Unicode, we can make it go.
