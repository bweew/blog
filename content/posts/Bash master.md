Rap about being the bash script master

Listen up folks, I've got a story to tell
About a skill that'll make your life so swell
I'm the bash script master, that's my claim to fame
Making the terminal my tool, and coding my game

From automation to scripting, I've got it all
Making tasks easier, and code standing tall
I can loop, I can condition, I can control
Making scripts that run smoother than a hot-oiled roll

Got the skills, got the knowledge, got the flow
Making scripts that work, and work it does show
Efficiency, reliability, and accuracy, that's me
The bash script master, for all to see

So if you need a script that'll run like a breeze
Just give me a shout, and I'll make it with ease
From shell to terminal, I'll make it work
With my skills, there's nothing I can't do, perk!

In conclusion, let me make it clear
I'm the bash script master, don't you fear
With my skills, I'll make your life so much better
So bring on the scripts, it's time to get setter!
