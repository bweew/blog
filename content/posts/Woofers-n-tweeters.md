Title: Woofers and Tweeters
---
Listen up, I got a story to tell
'Bout creatures that sing, you know them well
Some got a low pitch, some high like a bell
They live in pairs, in harmony they dwell

Chorus:
Woofers and tweeters, they make a sound so sweet
Like a symphony of nature, you can feel the beat
One howls deep, the other chirps so neat
Can you tell the difference, or is it a feat?

Verse 2:
One has a growl, the other a tweet
But both sing a melody, so unique and complete
The woofers are bold, the tweeters are discreet
They complement each other, like a feast and a treat

Chorus:
Woofers and tweeters, they make a sound so sweet
Like a symphony of nature, you can feel the beat
One howls deep, the other chirps so neat
Can you tell the difference, or is it a feat?

Bridge:
Whether you're a bird or a dog
You can sing your heart out, like a dialogue
With your partner in harmony, it's like a monologue
A language of music, like a universal catalogue

Chorus:
Woofers and tweeters, they make a sound so sweet
Like a symphony of nature, you can feel the beat
One howls deep, the other chirps so neat
Can you tell the difference, or is it a feat?

Outro:
Now you know the tale of the woofers and tweeters
Whether they're speakers or animals, they're such great features
So sing your song, like a bird or a dog
And let the music take you, like a misty fog
